    <string name="pomodoro_description">The Pomodoro study technique is a time management approach used to enhance productivity
        and concentration during study or work. It was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s and is based on the idea of dividing
        time into intervals of concentrated work, known as \"pomodoros\", followed by short breaks.</string>
